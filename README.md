# ST558Project2
Project 2 in ST 558 (601). Creating and deploying a shiny app with NBA play-by-play data:

This Shiny app looks at play-by-play data from 209 regular season games during the 2020-21 NBA season. Users are allowed to subset this data, so that they can view only games where the home or away teams are from a certain conference (Eastern or Western), the home or away teams scored a certain number of points in the game, or there were a certain number of combined total points in the game. 

Using the 'Data Download' tab, user can view the data, and only a subset of it if they have subsetted to data. They can also download the data set or a subset of it by clicked the 'Download Data' button at the bottom of the tab.

The 'Data Exploration' tab allows the user to view numeric and graphical summaries of the play-by-play data. This includes one-way and two-way contingency tables of categorical variables, means and standard deviations of numeric variables, and graphs summarizing the data. These summaries also only include the subset of the play-by-play data, if the user has chosen a subset.
